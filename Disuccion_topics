* The automated API and UI tests only cover the "happy path". Please describe in detail what other types of automated
 tests you would set up to verify that the file upload feature is working as expected.
  Scenarios when :
	Uploading file is not successful, how do we display it to the end user.
	When the network is down.
	Session expired when trying to do file upload
	Uploading an unsupported file
	Extremely large file is uploaded, this could cause a Denial of Service (DDos) attack and bring down the site.
	uploaded file contains an exploit, malware, malicious script or macro.

* In the top nav, the Transfers menu item contains a toggle button for Basic and Enhanced. 

1. What is the difference between these two options?
     Basic option performs a API call with the file content in binary format. Whereas Enhanced option is first uploads
     files to S3 and then performs API call.
2. How do these different methods compare to uploading a file through the API?
     Basic option is same as file upload through API using /files/contents/ endpoint.
     Whereas Enhanced option authenticates, uploads file to s3 , then informs api by sending data in
     request payload to /files/ endpoint and setting file access using file-access endpoint.
3. What security or additional testing concerns do you have with these two approaches?
   Basic option testing can be done with the scenarios stated above.
   Enhanced option testing would include additional scenarios, such as :
    1. S3 file upload failure
    2. Stress test and verify successful uploads to S3 have been recorded correctly in the API in
    both endpoints (files/ and file-access/)
    3. credentials/ files/ and file-access/ endpoints should also be tested with different request parameters
